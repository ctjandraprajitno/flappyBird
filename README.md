# 🐤 Flappy Bird

*A Python remake of the classic Flappy Bird game using the tsapp library.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose / Problem Statement

- Replicate the classic Flappy Bird gameplay in Python  
- Provide a lightweight, educational game to demonstrate basic 2D physics, collision detection, and event handling  
- Address the need for a beginner-friendly example of game development in Python

## 👥 Target Audience

- Students: learning Python or game development  
- Hobbyist programmers: exploring 2D game mechanics  
- Gamers: interested in simple, casual browser-style games

## 🛠️ Solution + ⚠️ Limitations

**Solution:**  
- Implements core Flappy Bird mechanics (gravity, jump, endless scrolling pipes, and scoring)  
- Uses the `tsapp` library for simplified rendering and input handling  

**Current Limitations:**  
- Only has a “press space” prompt and reset prompt  
- No on-screen GUI  
- Bird tilt logic not fully implemented  
- Gravity and jump power parameters need fine-tuning  
- No audio effects, pause/menu screens, or difficulty scaling

## 🔑 Key Features / Key Components

- 🌀 Game Loop: Frame-by-frame update of physics and rendering  
- 🕊️ Gravity & Jump Physics: Adjustable parameters for bird movement and pipe location  
- 💥 Collision Detection: Pipe and ground collisions end the game  
- 🌿 Procedural Pipe Generation: Randomized pipe gaps at fixed intervals that are reused everytime it passes the window  
- 🏆 Scoring System: Increment score each time the bird passes a pipe  

## ⚙️ Technical Challenges + 🌟 Future Plans

**Challenges Solved:**  
- Implementing smooth gravity vs. jump power balance  
- Optimizing gameplay to make it smoother by reusing pipes  
- Detecting precise collision boundaries between bird and pipes  

**Wishes / Future Additions:**  
- Fully-featured GUI overlay  
- Animated bird tilt based on vertical velocity  
- Sound effects and background music  
- Main menu, high-score persistence, and difficulty levels  
- Difficulty scaling according to the score

## 🗓️ Project Timeline

- **Day 1:**  
  - Set up project structure, Implement bird physics, basic rendering loop, add scrolling background, and add pipe generation  
- **Day 2:**  
  - Integrate collision logic and optimize pipe generation  
- **Day 3:**  
  - Integrate scoring system, option to reset, and high score tracker  
- **Ongoing:**  
  - GUI enhancements, parameter tweaks, and animations
