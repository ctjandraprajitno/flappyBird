# üê§ Flappy Bird

*A Python remake of the classic Flappy Bird game using the tsapp library.*

---

## üéØ Purpose / Problem Statement

- Replicate the classic Flappy Bird gameplay in Python  
- Provide a lightweight, educational game to demonstrate basic 2D physics, collision detection, and event handling  
- Address the need for a beginner-friendly example of game development in Python

## üë• Target Audience

- Students: learning Python or game development  
- Hobbyist programmers: exploring 2D game mechanics  
- Gamers: interested in simple, casual browser-style games

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution + ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

**Solution:**  
- Implements core Flappy Bird mechanics:
    - Scoring System:
    ```python



    ```
    - Jump & gravity:
    ```python



    ```
    - Background movement:
    ```python

    def move_bg(curr_sprites, SPEED): #funct to move spite then reset position
      '''
      Args:
          curr_sprites (obj): a sprite that's being used to be moved (background in this case)
          SPEED (int): a constant that store the speed of the sprite's movement (background in this case)
      '''
      curr_sprites.center_x -= SPEED
      if curr_sprites.x <= -curr_sprites.width / 2:
          curr_sprites.center_x += curr_sprites.width / 2

    ```
    - Scrolling pipes:
    ```python



    ```


(gravity, jump, endless scrolling pipes, and scoring)  
- Uses the `tsapp` library for simplified rendering and input handling  

**Current Limitations:**  
- Only has a ‚Äúpress space‚Äù prompt and reset prompt  
- No on-screen GUI  
- Bird tilt logic not fully implemented  
- Gravity and jump power parameters need fine-tuning  
- No audio effects, pause/menu screens, or difficulty scaling

## üîë Key Features / Key Components

- üåÄ Game Loop: Frame-by-frame update of physics and rendering  
- üïäÔ∏è Gravity & Jump Physics: Adjustable parameters for bird movement and pipe location  
- üí• Collision Detection: Pipe and ground collisions end the game  
- üåø Procedural Pipe Generation: Randomized pipe gaps at fixed intervals that are reused everytime it passes the window  
- üèÜ Scoring System: Increment score each time the bird passes a pipe  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Challenges + üåü Future Plans

**Challenges Solved:**  
- Implementing smooth gravity vs. jump power balance  
- Optimizing gameplay to make it smoother by reusing pipes  
- Detecting precise collision boundaries between bird and pipes  

**Wishes / Future Additions:**  
- Fully-featured GUI overlay  
- Animated bird tilt based on vertical velocity  
- Sound effects and background music  
- Main menu, high-score persistence, and difficulty levels  
- Difficulty scaling according to the score

## üóìÔ∏è Project Timeline

- **Day 1:**  
  - Set up project structure, Implement bird physics, basic rendering loop, add scrolling background, and add pipe generation  
- **Day 2:**  
  - Integrate collision logic and optimize pipe generation  
- **Day 3:**  
  - Integrate scoring system, option to reset, and high score tracker  
- **Ongoing:**  
  - GUI enhancements, parameter tweaks, and animations
