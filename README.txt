This is my first game python project that's replicate the game flappy bird.
I made this project using a library called tsapp which is a simplified version of pygame created by tech smart

I'm currently working on these features:
- make game logic to reset if lose
- make UI for score, reset, first indicator to press space, etc
- make a function to determine bird's "tilt". if speed == 0 then tilt = 0. if speed == max then tilt = 90. if speed == gravity then tilt = -90
- tweak the gravity and jump pwr

Please feel free to put any suggestion for this project down here:
