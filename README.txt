# Flappy Bird

*A Python remake of the classic Flappy Bird game using the tsapp library.*

---

## Purpose / Problem Statement
- Replicate the classic Flappy Bird gameplay in Python  
- Provide a lightweight, educational game to demonstrate basic 2D physics, collision detection, and event handling  
- Address the need for a beginner-friendly example of game development in Python

## Target Audience
- Students: learning Python or game development  
- Hobbyist programmers: exploring 2D game mechanics  
- Gamers: interested in simple, casual browser-style games

## Solution + Limitations
- Solution:  
  - Implements core Flappy Bird mechanics (gravity, jump, endless scrolling pipes, and scoring)  
  - Uses the `tsapp` library for simplified rendering and input handling  
- Current Limitations:  
  - Only has a “press space” prompt and reset prompt.
  - No on-screen GUI
  - Bird tilt logic not fully implemented  
  - Gravity and jump power parameters need fine-tuning  
  - No audio effects, pause/menu screens, or difficulty scaling

## Key Features / Key Components
- Game Loop: Frame-by-frame update of physics and rendering  
- Gravity & Jump Physics: Adjustable parameters for bird movement and pipe location  
- Collision Detection: Pipe and ground collisions end the game  
- Procedural Pipe Generation: Randomized pipe gaps at fixed intervals that are reused everytime it passes the window  
- Scoring System: Increment score each time the bird passes a pipe  

## Technical Challenges + Future Plans
- Challenges Solved:  
  - Implementing smooth gravity vs. jump power balance  
  - Optimizing gameplay to make it smoother by reusing pipes  
  - Detecting precise collision boundaries between bird and pipes  
- Wishes / Future Additions:  
  - Fully-featured GUI overlay    
  - Animated bird tilt based on vertical velocity  
  - Sound effects and background music  
  - Main menu, high-score persistence, and difficulty levels  
  - Difficulty scaling according to the score  

## Project Timeline
- Day 1:  
  - Set up project structure, Implement bird physics, basic rendering loop, add scrolling background, and add pipe generation  
- Day 2:  
  - Integrate collision logic and optimize pipe generation  
- Day 3:  
  - Integrate scoring system, option to reset, and high score tracker  
- Ongoing:  
  - GUI enhancements, parameter tweaks, and animations

## Tools and Resources Used
- Programming Language: Python 3.x
